    "# Introduction\n",
    "As a movie-lover, I have always wanted to lessen the amount of time it takes me to decide on watching a movie. Scrolling through endless lists of recommendations only to be sorely disappointed by whatever purveyor decides to place before me... I've decided to take matters into my own hands! With this project, I will attempt to build my own movie recommender that suits my needs. I've always suspected that movie and show recommendation systems are biased to promote certain new movies in order to increase exposure, but not necessarily give you want to watch. Using the kaggle dataset <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagrajdesai/latest-10000-movies-dataset-from-tmdb\">Latest 10000 Movies Dataset from TMDB\"</a> I will attempt to free myself from the Netflix/Prime/HBO Go algorithm once and for all!"

    "Seems as though, in general, the number of ratings have fallen, but the average rating has stayed relatively stable, hovering at about 6. This may have implications for more recent recommendations, as the average rating may be skewed by the number of ratings. The average popularity has also increased over time, which may be due to the increase in the number of movies released over time.\n",

    "By using the descriptions of movies alone, I was able to build an effective recommendation engine which can be used to recommend movies which are \"close\" to movies I've already seen using an euclidean distance function (displayed in the streamlit app attached to this repo). Generally speaking, clustering the movies into individual \"genre\" clusters has allowed me to attach at least some significance to the movie before watching it, so that I can make an informed choice prior to taking the plunge!"
